# w266_final_project

NOTE: The website to scrape transcripts is embedded in the TODO file with my login if you need it. 

5/24/2020:
Main things to figure out this week:
  - YH:  knowledge date file
  - SI, VR: Literature reading
  - YH, SI, VR: Think about how to scrape. 

Things to consider when brainstorming:
* Where do we want to store the data that will allow collaboration?
* How do we construct a clean dataset (what data should be included, what tagging?)
